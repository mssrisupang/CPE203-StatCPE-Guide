# Privacy Policy for CPE203 StatCPE Guide (Custom GPT)

**Last updated:** April 2, 2025

## Privacy Policy

I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. To that end, I have designed this application, CPE203 StatCPE Guide, from the ground up to ensure that your data stays completely private.

I don’t want the responsibility of managing your personal data correctly, so I don’t collect any personal data from you. I believe this approach is better for both of us.

At the same time, CPE203 StatCPE Guide uses the OpenAI API to provide its services. By using this application, you acknowledge and agree to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy. I encourage you to review OpenAI’s privacy policy to understand how your data is handled. Please be aware that I am not responsible for OpenAI’s data handling practices. If you have any concerns or questions about their policies, please contact OpenAI directly.

## Personally-Identifying Information

The application does not gather or transmit any personally-identifiable information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences about the user interface within its local database. All data exchanged with the OpenAI API is anonymous, and I do not store any user-specific data.

## Business Transfers

If the app, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that the app goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (Since the app does not collect any personal information, there would likely be minimal effect from this in practice.)

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and at my sole discretion. Your continued use of this application after any changes to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

## Indemnity

By using this application, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the creator of this app, as well as any associated parties, from any losses, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses) incurred or suffered by us arising out of your use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of this privacy policy.

## Contact

Your continued use of the application will be regarded as acceptance of my practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how your data is handled, feel free to contact me at mail@customeGPT.com.

This policy is effective as of April 2, 2025.
